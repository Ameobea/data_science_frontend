# Data Science 101 Project Frontend

A visualization and analysis tool for the data from our project.  Its purpose is to provide users a simple and easy-to-use interface through which the data can be accessed, analyzed, and added to in a sustainable and organized fashion.

## Tech Stack

* This tool is built using `create-react-app` and utilizing the `react-bootstrap` components for its input.

* The data is fetched from a remote file and stored using PouchDB so that the entire application can be run entirely client-side without the need for persistence servers or other maintenance.

* The Highcharts charting library is used for the visualizations.

## Roadmap

* Data file loading + saving
* Set up Github kanban for this project
* Data export as CSV
* Dynamic data visualization using Highcharts
